# tic-tac-toe - Using React
Tic-Tac-Toe is one of the oldest and most popular board games in the world.
We can play Tic-Tac-Toe with our friends physically using boards, pebbles, sticks, etc.,
but we can also play the game with our friends on a web browser. 
In this repo, weâ€™ll build a Tic-Tac-Toe game from scratch using React Hooks.
